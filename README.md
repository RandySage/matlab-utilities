matlab-utilities
================

A collection of various functions that I find myself using frequently and wishing MathWorks had included.  I thought I was going to be able to just fork such a repository and start supplementing it, but I either searched poorly or there is a lack of catch-all MATLAB repositories.

License notes: 
 1. I have selected the Apache license to support the event that others want to contribute or fork the repository, so that the patent grant is available.  However, I am rather flexible regarding my contributions and am willing to provide them under other licenses - just contact me. 
 2. Although I will take care to ensure that anything I copy into this repository can be Apache Licensed, I anticipate that I may use one or more sub-modules for non-Apache items.  In the event I do that, I plan to be rather conspicuous about it, but remember that the license only applies to the contents and not the referenced sub-folder contents.  At a minimum, I will have a separate set of Third Party Tools.
